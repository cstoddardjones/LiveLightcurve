# rotato
Software to produce light curves from light from a web-cam.

Connect a web-cam or used a built in one to measure the light that is reflected off something. Designed to be used with an object on a turntable to produce a rotational lightcurve of that object. This is how small-bodies in space are measured.

Collaboration is welcomed! If you have any suggestions or ammendments to the software - email me at cai@cometchasers.com.

This software is open-source and free to use, but please give credit to Cai Stoddard-Jones or Comet Chasers.
